# Mati kutt Portfolio
 A small collection of projects to show off

Block - A quick endless runner created entirely using squares
Zombie Shooter Tech Demo - Essentially a collection of game mechanics I created, not quite a full project yet
Bounce Draw - A small, physics based game where you draw on a two-dimensional black canvas using a ball with physics
Robot Run - A single-level platformer game with some interesting stuff like animations, level creation, collectibles.
FOV system - A system that essentially creates a field of view, you could attach it to a player object and only render what it would see, so nothing through walls.
